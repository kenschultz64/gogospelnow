# Spec: Enhance codebase stability and documentation

## Overview
This track focuses on improving the long-term maintainability and reliability of the GoGospelNow translator by establishing a robust testing foundation and clarifying the development environment setup.

## Goals
- Implement unit tests for critical components in \	ranslator_core.py\.
- Achieve >80% code coverage for the core translation logic.
- Refine the existing documentation (\README.md\, \INSTALL.txt\) for clarity and accuracy based on the current codebase state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A test suite exists that can be run with a single command (e.g., \pytest\).
- Core translation and transcription coordination functions are covered by tests.
- All tests pass in the local development environment.
- Documentation accurately reflects the necessary steps to set up and run the project from scratch.
