# Roadmap 🚀

This document outlines the future development plans and upcoming features for the GoGospelNow Translator.

## Future Features

1.  **Smart Monitor Management**
    *   Develop a method to pre-determine which monitor the translation screen opens on.
    *   Remove top borders for a cleaner look while ensuring the window can still be closed (avoiding "stuck open" issues over the main screen).

2.  **UI/UX Modernization**
    *   Overhaul the application's cosmetics for a sleek, functional, and modern design.
    *   Focus on simplicity and user-friendliness.

3.  **Mobile Companion App**
    *   Create a dedicated listening app for Android and iOS.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Receive real-time translation text and audio.
        *   Keep the screen awake (prevent timeout) so users can continuously read/hear translations.

4.  **GitHub & Release Management**
    *   Establish a streamlined process for version releases.
    *   Determine the best strategy for updates (overwriting vs. new release spaces).

5.  **Expanded API Support (Cloud LLMs)**
    *   Add a dedicated API configuration space for translation functions.
    *   Integrate support for major cloud AI providers:
        *   **OpenAI**
        *   **Groq**
        *   **Grok** (xAI)
        *   **Mistral**
    *   Update documentation to include endpoint configuration and API key management for these services.
